# Web Content Scraper

An app that visits http://shirts4mike.com daily, obtains the price, title, url and image url data for each shirt, and saves the data to a csv file.

This project was done in conjunction with my TeamTreehouse full-stack JavaScript TechDegree, as the sixth project of twelve. The project directed me to research and implement relevant and up-to-date modules on npm for purposes of web scraping and csv file writing. I found and selected Osmosis for the scraping component and Csv-Writer for the file writing. The project then required that the app visit the above website and record the data indicated on a daily basis into a csv file. The app is currently tailored to this project's specifications, but it can easily be altered for other purposes.

## Installation:

With npm and node.js installed on your computer and the project files downloaded, use `npm install` to download all of the project's dependencies.

## Usage:

Once the project's dependencies are installed, use `npm start` to run the app.
